YORKIE HELPER IMAGE SETUP
=============================================

To see your Yorkie in the corner of the app:

1. Copy your yorkie.png file to this folder
   (avatar_video_app/frontend/public/)

2. Make sure it's named exactly: yorkie.png

3. Restart the frontend (npm run dev)

The Yorkie will appear in the bottom-right corner
and give helpful tips as you create your avatar videos!

If you don't have a Yorkie image yet, the app will
show a dog emoji as a fallback.
